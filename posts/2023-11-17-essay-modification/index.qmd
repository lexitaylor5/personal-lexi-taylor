We Googled You

The central point of this case study is that times have changed with the internet, and whether you like it or not your information can potentially be posted everywhere. This case showed what a negative impact the internet can cause for people that are looking for jobs. Nowadays having all the qualifications for the job and having a great interview does not mean anything. If you have an inappropriate or negative post on the internet from even years ago, that can put you in jeopardy for a job even if you are the best candidate for it. The ethical issue of this study, though, is if it is really right to judge whether someone should get a job or not based on what they posted or what was posted about them years ago. While looking potential job candidates up on the internet may not be the most “ethical” thing to do, it is inevitable. If a company does not do it themselves their competitor will, which can put them in jeopardy depending on what is found that they did not know about their employer themselves. In the case it talked about how Hathway Jone’s CEO, Fred, found a promising candidate for the job, but after looking her up on the internet he realized she might not be as fit for the job as it had seemed. After looking through the internet it was found that the candidate, Mimi, was protesting China’s treatment of a dissident journalist, which is not a good look for a company looking for someone for the Shanghai position. This left the CEO in a predicament of whether he should base hiring her off her references and interview or if he should base it off what was posted on the internet about her. 
The social location that the author is writing from is leaning more towards disagreeing that a revelation on the Internet should disqualify a potential candidate for a job. In the case that the author wrote it is shown that nowadays, Google is going to be a huge source when potentially hiring a candidate. There won’t be many companies who will not do a search on the internet to learn more about a possible employee. Even though this is true, the author seems to lean more towards not letting the internet dictate these things because dirt and even false information can be found on just about anyone if you look them up. The Internet displays information good or bad and true or not, and that is just something that comes with the world we live in now. The author also seems to believe when it comes to finding the best employee, you cannot always just pick the ones who play it safe. 
There are many different points that the authors collectively agree on, but there are also points that they tend to disagree on. For instance, there are some perspectives from the younger generation and then the perspective of those who are older and not as internet savvy. Jeffrey A. Joerres acknowledges that the internet is going to play a huge role in our lives from here on out. Before a company is going to even consider hiring someone, they are going to Google the candidate and see what they can find. This case shows why it is so important for younger people to watch what they are posting on the internet because a lot of times once it is on there, it cannot be deleted. Joerres also recommend that before going into an interview, search the internet and see what you can find about yourself. That way if you are asked questions about what may have been posted you are on top of it and able to answer efficiently and effectively. From his perspective, the internet plays such a vital role in the world and there is really nothing that can be done about it. 
Fred Westen has a little bit of a different opinion on the case. He thinks if Mimi is qualified for the job, has the references, and her interview went well then she should be hired and what was on the internet should be ignored. He believes solely using the internet to influence your decision on hiring someone can be a form of discrimination and at the end of the day that will backfire on companies. Also, Westen makes a point that not everything that is on the internet is always true, so if you are going to use what is on the internet when deciding on whether to hire someone or not you need to clarify the situation with the person to make sure what is on there is actually true. He also believes that hiring standards are going to have to change, or the right people just will not end up getting hired. 
Danah M. Boyd admits that she grew up with this technology and is part of the generation that should be embarrassed by what was posted. Boyd points out, though, that being part of this generation is significant in learning and maturing as a person. Without these mistakes people may never learn. Cultural norms have shifted making the Internet a huge source for a lot of things. She believes that employers need people who have the qualifications and references, but also need those who are creative and outside the box. So based on this case study, Boyd believes that Mimi should be hired, or the company will be missing out on a great employee.
Lastly, Michael Fertik believes by just simply googling anyone, there will always be a little bit of dirt that will be found on them. With that being said, based on the case Fertik does not believe that Mimi should be hired. He believes that since it is such a high-profile job that the content posted about her online is enough to not hire her. Mimi cannot remove the articles from the web, since she did not post them herself, so they will always be there. Fertik believes that Mimi should have told Fred about the articles when he was interviewing her so she could show honesty and assert some control. Even though Fertik does not think she should be hired for this specific job, he does think that there are things that she can do to make up for what was posted about her on the internet, which will allow her to get jobs in the future. With the internet information will go so much further whether it is good or bad. 
Overall, I feel like the consensus all of these authors came to was that the internet is going to be used when looking at potential employers, whether it is the “ethical” thing to do or not. I feel like all of the authors also believe that people need to be very cautious and aware of what they post or what is posted about them because it can be used to their disadvantage at times. There is no changing the fact that the use of the internet is rapidly increasing, so it is something that needs to be embraced and something people need to be more knowledgeable about no matter what age.
