title: Major Enhancement
---

<blockquote>
The major enhancement I made was to the navbar on my website. I was able to change the background color, the style of the text, the color of the font when hovering over the headers, and made a dropdown menu for `articles` and `blog`. The image below shows the enhancement to my navbar. 


<img src="/images/major.jpg" style="float: middle; margin: 5px 20px 5px 10px;" width = 400>

## Navbar Background and Font Style
<blockquote>
The way I was able to change the background color and the font of my navbar will be demonstrated in the code below. 

```.js
.navbar-brand{
    font-family: "Consolas";
  }

  .quarto-listing-category {
    font-family: "Consolas";
  }
  
  .navbar-dark, .navbar-light, .navbar {
      background-color: palevioletred;
  }
```
In order for this code to work, I had to place it in the `style.css` folder. There are many different fonts and colors to choose from. To see some of the font styles in Visual Studio Code click the button below.
```{=html}
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">

## Navbar Hover Color
<blockquote>
I was able to add the color oranage when hovering over the words on the navbar by adding the code below in my `style.css` folder.

```.js
  .navbar-dark .navbar-nav .nav-link:hover {
    color: orange;
    font-weight: 400;
  }
```

## Navbar Drop Down
<blockquote>
In order to add the drop down to the `articles` and `blog` I had to add some things to my `_quarto.yml` folder. The code is below. 

```.js
website:
  title: "Lexi Taylor's Website"
  site-path: "/warmup-lexi-taylor/"
  navbar:
    tools:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - href: about.qmd
        text: About
      - text: Articles
        menu:
          - href: articles/index.qmd
            text: "Articles" 
          - href: articles/article_01.qmd
            text: "Minimum Function"
          - href: articles/article_02.qmd
            text: "Recursion" 
          - href: articles/article_03.qmd
            text: "Major Enhancement"
      - text: Blog
        menu:
          - href: posts/index.qmd
            text: "Blog"
