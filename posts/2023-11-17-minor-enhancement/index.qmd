## Introduction 

<blockquote>
The minor enhancement that I made was to the Home page of my website. On the home page I added two clickable icons that take you to my GitHub and LinkedIn pages.

## What It Looks Like
<blockquote>
As you can see in the image below, under the "Welcome!" there are two icons that can be clicked on. 
<img src="/images/minor.jpg" style="float: middle; margin: 5px 20px 5px 10px;" width = 400>
</blockquote>


## How I Did It
<blockquote>
When making my enhancement I reffered back to the Quarto website [here](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-navigation.html). This website shows how to get these tools on the navbar. I wanted to take a different approach by adding these tools to my `home` page instead. I provided the code below that I used to do this. 

```.js
---
title: "Welcome!"
comments: False
format:
  html:
    page-layout: full
about:
  id: about
  template: jolla
  links:
    - icon: clipboard-data
      text: LinkedIn
      href: "https://linkedin.com/in/alexis-taylor-b41a90293"
    - icon: github
      text: GitHub
      href: "https://github.com/lexitaylor5"
back-to-top-navigation: false
---
```

The code contains two links that both contain an `icon`, `text`, and an `href`. The setup of these links is what makes them two clickable icons on my `home` page.
