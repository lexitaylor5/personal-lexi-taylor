## How to Add a Logo to the Sidebar
<blockquote>
On the sidebar of my website, I added a Georgetown logo to the top of it. I have provided the code below on how I did this. 

```.js
  sidebar:

    - id: none
      style: "docked"
      background: light
      logo: images/gclogo.jpg
      pinned: true 
      align: center
      collapse-level: 2
      contents:
        - section: "Articles"
          href: articles/index.qmd
          contents: 
            - text: "Minimum Function"
              href:  articles/article_01.qmd
            - text: "Recursion"
              href:  articles/article_02.qmd
            - text: "Major Enhancement"
              href:  articles/article_03.qmd
        - section: "Posts"
          href: posts/index.qmd
          contents: "posts/*/*.qmd"
          sort:
            - "date desc"
```
In my `_quarto.yml` in the sidebar part of my code I added a section called `logo`. I then inserted the image name into that section which placed the logo on the top left of my website.

## Adding Buttons
<blockquote>
I also decided to add `buttons` that are clickable and will take you to different links I have on my website. Instead of the clickable links looking like this: [here]()

I made them look like this:
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">
    <a href="">
      Click Here!
    </a>
</button>


The button helps make my website look more appealing and also stands out more compared to the hyperlink.

## How I Made It
<blockquote>
In order to make a button I used the code below. The `href` in the code below is where you provide the link of where you are trying to go to. Underneath the `href` is where you put what you want the button to say. For example, my button says "Click Here!" 

```.js
```{=html}
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">
    <a href="link">
      Click Here!
    </a>
</button>
```

By clicking this link below, it will take you to a website that gives different custom button styles.
```{=html}
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/buttons/#css">
      Click Here!
    </a>
</button>
```

</blockquote>

## Button Formatting 
<blockquote>
The formatting of the button can be done in the `style.css` folder. I have provided the code from my folder below. I made a couple of changes to my button. For example, I changed the color of it to `lightpink` and I made it have a box-shadow stlyle that was `palevioletred`. There are many different colors that you can choose from when making a button. There are also many different ways you can modify it. For example, I used the website below when looking at different ways to style my button.

```{=html}
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">
    <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-button-style-hover-color-and-background/">
      Button Style Website
    </a>
</button>
```


```.js
  .btn-primary {
    background-color: lightpink !important;
    outline-color: transparent;
    outline-style:solid;
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 4px palevioletred;
  }
```
