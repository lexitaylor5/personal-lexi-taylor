## Introduction to the Minor Enhancement

<blockquote>
The minor enhancement that I made was to the Home page of my website. On the home page I added a two icons that you can click on that take you to my GitHub and LinkedIn pages.

## What the Minor Enhancement looks like
<blockquote>
As you can see in the image below, under the "Welcome!" there are two icons that can be clicked on. 
<img src="/images/enhancement.jpg" style="float: middle; margin: 5px 20px 5px 10px;" width = 400>

## How I made the enhancement
<blockquote>
When making my enhancement I reffered back to the Quarto website [here](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-navigation.html). This website is a great resource when learning how to make a website in VS Code. The website provides an example of how to get the tools on the navbar. Instead of having my clickable icons on the navabr, I decided to add them to my home page [here](http://localhost:7820). In order to do this under my `index.qmd` I provided the code to get these icons. The image belows is the code I used. <img src="/images/code.jpg" style="float: middle; margin: 5px 20px 5px 10px;" width = 400>
